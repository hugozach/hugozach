爱是一盏温暖的灯，照亮人生路上的黑暗，驱散无心的寂寞。爱是温暖的光。当你在黑暗中跌跌撞撞时，爱会为你点亮一盏灯，一盏灯，一盏温暖的灯。

夏绵尊先生曾经一边流泪一边翻译一本书。他说：“没有情感和爱的教育，就像没有水的池塘。没有水，就没有池塘。没有爱，就没有教育。”

这本书是爱的教育，意大利作家埃德蒙多·德·阿米什于1886年创作的儿童小说。

《爱的教育》讲述了各种各样的爱情，每一种爱情都是平凡却感人的。整本书以日记的形式出现。整本书围绕着小男孩amritco展开。

Amritco 就像我们隔壁的一个小男孩。和90%以上的孩子一样，他也害怕上学。老师走的时候他也会难过，和身边的人吵架，他会…… Amritco的形象让人觉得很亲近，很亲近，很真实。

全书讲述了amritco和身边的形形色色的人，慈悲的妈妈，温柔的爸爸，关心学生的老师，善良可爱的朋友……虽然主角是amritco，但他其实是用日记来讲述身边的老师把所有的爱都献给他和他的孩子的人。
